            <p class="publications__abstract">NaturalCC is a sequence modeling toolkit that allows researchers and developers to train custom models for many software engineering tasks, e.g., code summarization, code generation, code retrieval, code clone detection, and so on. Our vision is to bridge the gap between programming language and natural language through some machine learning techniques.</p>

            <span class="publications__year">ICSE 2022</span>
            <p class="publications__abstract">In this paper, we conduct a thorough structural analysis aiming to provide an interpretation of pre-trained language models for source code (e.g., CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT) from three distinctive perspectives: (1) attention analysis, (2) probing on the word embedding, and (3) syntax tree induction.</p>

            <span class="publications__year">ASE 2018</span>
            <p class="publications__abstract">In this paper, we incorporate an abstract syntax tree structure as well as sequential content of code snippets into a deep reinforcement learning framework (i.e., actor-critic network) for the task of source code summarization.</p>

            <span class="publications__authors">Yao Wan, Jingdong Shu, Yulei Sui, Guandong Xu, Zhou Zhao, Jian Wu, Philip S. Yu</span>
            <span class="publications__year">ASE 2019</span>
            <p class="publications__abstract">We propose a novel multi-modal attention network for semantic source code retrieval. A comprehensive multi-modal representation is developed for representing unstructured and structured features of source code, with one LSTM for the sequential tokens of code, a Tree-LSTM for the AST of code and a GGNN (Gated Graph Neural Network) for the CFG of code.</p>
